ALL TOOLS ARE OMAKE _ONLY, DO NOT COME RUNNING WITH PROBLEMS, BUGS, REQUESTS OR QUESTIONS HOW TO USE THEM.
Also they might be of absolutely no use to you.


crack2dx_new:
	cracks and decomposes a .2dx file with variable filenames; supports 9th style to Empress
	"crack2dx_new <2dx file> <output format>"
	output format (0~4):
		0: 1.wav, 2.wav...
		1: 0001.wav, 0002.wav...
		2 (default): 01.wav, 02.wav..., ZZ.wav
		3: 01.wav, 02.wav..., FF.wav

encrypt2dx:
	encrypts unencrypted .2dx files (or any other file, no idea why you'd want to do that though)
	"encrypt2dx <file>"
	choose the encryption you want, the output will always be "encrypted.2dx"

parse1:
	parses a .1 file and prints various information, mainly for debugging
	"parse1 <file> <verbosity>"
	verbosity:
		v (default): print standard info and summary only
		vv: same as v, also print bpm info and measure related events
		vvv: print everything except for keysound preload and autoplay events
		vvvv: print pretty much everything

create2dx_dumb:
	creates an (troopers-)encrypted and unencrypted .2dx file from a .bme/.bms file or from BME-style named wav files in the same folder
	"create2dx_dumb <bme/bmsfile>"
	the file parameter is optional; if given it searches the .bme/.bms for wav references and create the .2dx files from wavs in the same folder
	if no parameter is given, it simply searches the current directory for BME-style named wav files and uses those in order instead, hence _dumb

timebase_single:
	does the same as timebase, but can be used on a batch of files instead.
	THIS OVERWRITES THE ORIGINAL FILES, MAKE BACKUPS BEFOREHAND, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! THIS ALSO KILLS EVERYTHING EXCEPT .1 FILES, THERE ARE NO SAFETIES!
	"timebase_single <file1> <file2> ..."
	you will need to specify the base fps currently used inside the .1 file (or 0 or 1 for the respective defaults)
	use your refresh rate for the target fps
	this also allows converting from troopers to gold and below:
		insert 1000 for the troopers fps and the default gold/dd-and-below fps

merge1:
	merges several .1 files into one; this can help when you have too large .2dx files because or different sounding charts
	"merge1"
	the .1 files have to be named according to the difficulty you want to extract from them:
	b.1, n7.1...a14.1, so the final .1 file will have the n7 chart from n7.1, the h14 chart from h14.1 etc.
	if you also provide a base.1, then all charts from that file will be taken and selectively overwritten by the other files you provide
		(usefull if you only want to overwrite one chart out of 6 or so)

checkeout:
	checks your iidx environment for sanity to help search for errors
	does not currently support graphics stuff like banners, but pretty much everything else that usually goes wrong
	first of all PLACE checkeout.exe IN YOUR "data" FOLDER! RUN IT FROM THE COMMAND PROMPT (cmd.exe), NOT BY DOUBLECLICK!
	"checkeout <DECODED eout.bin> <verbosity>"
	by default both warnings and errors are displayed, verbosity = "v" means errors only, "vv" means warnings only
	warnings ("__") can be ignored for the most part (missing videos etc.)
	errors ("!!") will most likely prevent iidx from booting or make the respective song crash.
