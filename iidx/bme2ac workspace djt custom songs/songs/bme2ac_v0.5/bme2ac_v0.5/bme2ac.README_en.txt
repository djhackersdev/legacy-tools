=============

HOWTO:
Download SoX here:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sox/sox-14.1.0.zip?download
Extract sox.exe into your windows folder.
Put both convertwav.bat and bme2ac.exe into the same folder as the BMS files you want to convert.

Run convertwav.bat. It will convert all wavs in the same folder to a format Troopers can understand. You can find the original files in the newly created folder "old".
Now rename all your BMS/BME files like this:
b.bme n7.bme h7.bme a7.bme n14.bme h14.bme a14.bme
Now run bme2ac. It will produce 3 files: output.1, encrypted.2dx and decrypted.2dx. The former two files are now usable with Troopers.

=============

IMPORTANT NOTES:
Should bme2ac tell you that it can't find some wav files, fill those in with short silent wav files, _NOT_ 0 byte files or other garbage. Don't forget to run convertwav.bat again.
Charts without keysounds probably won't work.
Should you choose to replace an original IIDX song with a custom one, make sure that your new song has at least
  the same number of charts as the old one or Troopers will refuse to boot.
  You can for example copy over n7.bme to a14.bme if needed.
