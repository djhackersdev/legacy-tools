Bemani DLLs source release
by DJ Hackers
11-Nov-2008

This source tree requires Visual Studio 2008 to build, as well a fairly recent DirectX SDK in your build path. Patches always welcome.

Notes:
* I haven't done any extensive testing of the current GFDM code. It probably lags like hell.
* I haven't even started trying to do e-Amusement for GFDM either.
* My notes on how the e-Amusement protocol works are going to remain secret. Sorry, but there's too much potential for abuse here.
