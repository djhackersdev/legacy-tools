Basic uses:

This program has not undergone much testing as we are still unaware
of it's full potential. We have currently got it to change some
difficulties on HS songs, but we don't really know what else it can
do. It potentially has the ability to Add songs to IIDX AC mixes.
From what we can tell it can currently only save proper eouts in
HS format. We have not been able to get it to work properly with DD
or GOLD. We have also not been able to try to add older songs as the
Master Songlist CSV file (eout.csv) was missing from the 2ch rar we
found. If anyone finds the eout.csv please send it to us. If anyone
has any luck with this program please post it in this thread:

To use the program, you must first decrypt the eout.bin from the game:
decrypt eout.bin eout.dec

You then run that dec file into eoutEdit.exe(.jar) and edit as needed.
Afterwards you must re-encrypt the eout.dec file:
encrypt eout.dec eout.bin
