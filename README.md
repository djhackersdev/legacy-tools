# Legacy tools for bemani games

This repository collects various legacy tooling that was floating around the internet
at some point in the past. Some tooling is binary only if no source was released so
far.

These should either serve as a reference for anyone who wants to incorporate parts into
other projects or just use them for any applicable task.

We don't take any credit for these tools. This repository is purely for preservation
and will not be used for any development work.
