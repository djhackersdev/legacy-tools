This game loader allows DDR arcade mixes to boot even
if the onboard or pccard data has been modified. It
requires either a universal modboard or legit 700A01
and works with 2 disc hacks of the following mixes:

DDR 4thMIX
DDR 4thMIX PLUS
DDR 5thMIX
DDR MAX
DDR MAX2
DDR EXTREME
DS EuroMIX2

Warning:

Modifying game data and forcing the game to attempt
loading anyway results in undefined behavior and
could potentially damage your hardware. Use at your
own risk.
