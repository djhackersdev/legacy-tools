Disclaimer: I did not create this. 99% of the credit for this tool goes to daydensteve. He created the original but he has not been around for about a month. If he requests that I remove this so he can re-release his own copy I will.

I started the decompile on the original .exe provided by daydensteve and got a ton of help from atomriot who eventually recompiled this and got it working with DDR 2013. I have tested it and it works.

Refer to this http://bemaniso.ws/torrents.php?id=3973 if you want more information on the original exe and how it works.
